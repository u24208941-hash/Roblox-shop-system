A simple Roblox GUI setup that allows players to open and close a shop panel using a button.
This is the base system for a future full shop with buying items and inventory.

Current Script Functionality:
Detects when the player clicks the ShopButton

an example of the script to work:

--//Variables
local shop = script.Parent.ShopFrame 
local open = script.Parent.Open 
local exit = shop.Exit


--//Open
open.MouseButton1Click:Connect(function()
	shop.Visible = true 
	open.Visible = false 
end)

--//Close
exit.MouseButton1Click:Connect(function()
	shop.Visible = false
	open.Visible = true
end)
